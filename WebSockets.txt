we’ll be working with the gorilla/websocket package 

WebSockets are upgraded HTTP connections that live until the connection is killed by 
either the client or the server.

 It’s through this WebSocket connection that we can perform duplex communication
 we can communicate to-and-from the server from our client using this single connection.

REALITY OF WEBSOCKETS

 WebSockets is that they use a grand total of 1 TCP connection and all communication is 
 done over this single long-lived TCP connection. 


TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) 

1! We establish a connection between a router and a computer or mobile device 

2! TCP protocol allows two endpoints in a shared computer network to establish a
   connection that enables a two-way transmission of data


How exactly do TCP connections work?

=>TCP allows for transmission of information in both directions. This means that computer
systems that communicate over TCP can send and receive data at the same time, similar
to a telephone conversation. The protocol uses segments (packets) as the basic units 
of data transmission.




The three-way handshake: How a TCP connection is established

The actual process for establishing a connection with the TCP protocol is as follows:

1.First, the requesting client sends the server a SYN packet or segment
 (SYN stands for synchronize) with a unique, random number. 
 This number ensures full transmission in the correct order (without duplicates).
2.If the server has received the segment, it agrees to the connection by returning 
 a SYN-ACK packet (ACK stands for acknowledgment) including the client's sequence 
 number plus 1. It also transmits its own sequence number to the client.
3.Finally, the client acknowledges the receipt of the SYN-ACK segment by
 sending its own ACK packet, which in this case contains the server's sequence number plus 1. 
 At the same time, the client can already begin transferring data to the server.
